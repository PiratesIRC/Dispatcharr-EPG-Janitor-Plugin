# EPG Janitor

Keep your Electronic Program Guide clean, accurate, and complete. EPG Janitor operates on channels that already exist in Dispatcharr — it finds broken EPG assignments (no program data), intelligently matches EPGs to channels using callsign/location/network scoring plus a fuzzy pipeline with built-in aliases, and provides bulk cleanup tools for removing EPG from hidden channels or by REGEX.

## Requires

Dispatcharr v0.20.0 or newer. Python 3.13+ (bundled). No external dependencies.

## Key features

- **Auto-Match EPG** — weighted structural scoring (callsign 50 / state 30 / city 20 / network 10) + Lineuparr-style 4-stage fuzzy pipeline (alias → exact → substring → token-sort), takes the higher score. Identical-name matches score 100.
- **Scan & Heal** — find channels whose current EPG has no program data and walk ranked candidates for a working replacement (respects fallback source allowlist).
- **~200 built-in aliases** (FS1/FS2, CSPAN variants, rebrands like EPIX→MGM+, MSNBC→MS NOW, getTV→GREATTV, DIY→Magnolia, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries→Hallmark Mystery, Justice Network→True Crime Network). User-extendable via a JSON `custom_aliases` setting.
- **Regional differentiation** (East/West/Pacific, Pacific ≡ West) — lineup channels with regional markers only match compatible EPG feeds, even when `ignore_regional_tags=true`.
- **Per-category normalization toggles** — quality (`[HD]`, `[4K]`), regional (East/West/Pacific), geographic (`US:`, `[CA]`), misc (`(A)`, `(CX)`) stripped independently.
- **Performance** — pre-normalization cache + per-EPG attribute cache. ~7–8 min for a 21,480-EPG × 2,950-channel run.
- **Bulk management** — remove EPG by REGEX, from hidden channels, or from entire groups. Tag channels with missing program data via configurable suffix.
- **CSV exports** — every dry-run and apply exports results with confidence scores, match method, and reasoning.

## Settings

Organized into sections via UI dividers: Scope, Auto-Match, Scan & Heal, Cleanup & Maintenance, Normalization Toggles, Custom Aliases. Dynamic per-country channel-database toggles (US, UK, CA, DE, ES, FR, IN, MX, NL, AU, BR) auto-generated based on shipped `*_channels.json` files.

## Actions

14 color-coded action buttons grouped by destructiveness (blue outlines for info, cyan for dry-runs, green-filled for apply-style, orange/red-filled for destructive) with confirmation dialogs on anything that mutates channel state. Emoji labels.

## How it differs from other matching plugins

- **Not a channel creator.** EPG Janitor does not create channels or scan M3U sources — it works on channels you already have in Dispatcharr. For provider-lineup-driven channel creation see [Lineuparr](https://github.com/PiratesIRC/Dispatcharr-Lineuparr-Plugin).
- **EPG-first matching.** The weighted pipeline is tuned for matching EPG entries (which often carry callsigns + geographic context for US broadcast) rather than IPTV stream names.
- **Heal semantics.** First-class support for replacing broken EPG assignments with working ones — walks ranked candidates and validates program-data availability before applying.

## Install

Install from the Dispatcharr Plugin Hub (once available) or download the latest release from the source repo and import via **Plugins → Import Plugin** in the Dispatcharr UI.
