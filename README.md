### CSV Export Fields
The CSV file contains the following columns:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `channel_id` | Internal Dispatcharr channel ID | `123` |
| `channel_name` | Display name of the channel | `ESPN HD` |
| `channel_number` | Channel number (if assigned) | `101.0` |
| `channel_group` | Channel group name | `Sports` |
| `epg_channel_id` | TVG ID from EPG data | `espn.us` |
| `epg_channel_name` | Name from EPG data | `ESPN` |
| `epg_source` | EPG source name | `XMLTV Sports Guide` |
| `scanned_at` | Timestamp of scan | `2025-01-15T10:30:00` |

### CSV Export Location
CSV files are exported to: `/data/exports/epg_janitor_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

Example: `/data/exports/epg_janitor_results_20250115_103000.csv`

## üìä CSV Export Fields

The exported CSV includes the following fields:

- `channel_id`: Internal Dispatcharr channel ID
- `channel_name`: Display name of the channel
- `channel_number`: Channel number (if assigned)
- `channel_group`: Channel group name
- `epg_channel_id`: TVG ID from EPG data
- `epg_channel_name`: Name from EPG data
- `epg_source`: EPG source name
- `scanned_at`: Timestamp of when the channel was scanned

## ü§î Understanding the Results

EPG Janitor identifies channels that fall into this specific scenario:
- Channel has `epg_data` assigned (not null)
- The assigned EPG data has no `ProgramData` records for the specified timeframe
- These channels will show "No Program Information Available" in the TV guide

**Note**: Channels without any EPG assignment get dummy program data and are not flagged by this plugin.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **READ ONLY ACCESS**: This plugin only identifies issues - manual intervention required to fix EPG assignments
- **No Modifications**: The plugin does not modify any channel or EPG data
- **Information Only**: Use the results to guide your manual EPG management workflow

## üîß Troubleshooting

### First Step: Restart Container
For any plugin issues, always try restarting the Dispatcharr container first:
```bash
docker restart dispatcharr
```
This resolves most plugin loading, configuration, and caching issues.

### Plugin Not Appearing
- Check plugin files are in the correct location: `/data/plugins/epg_janitor/`
- Verify file permissions are correct
- Restart container: `docker restart dispatcharr`
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Reload Discovery

### Settings Not Saving
- Click the "Save Settings" button after making changes
- Refresh the browser page
- Restart container: `docker restart dispatcharr`

### Actions Not Working
- Verify plugin loaded successfully in logs
- Check for JavaScript errors in the browser console
- Restart container: `docker restart dispatcharr`

### No Results Found
- Verify channels have EPG data assigned in Dispatcharr
- Check that your EPG sources are actively providing data
- Ensure the time window includes periods where you expect program data
- Try scanning all groups instead of specific ones

### CSV Export Issues
- Ensure `/data/exports/` directory exists and is writable
- Check available disk space
- Verify no permission issues with the Dispatcharr data directory

### General Plugin Issues
- Always restart the container first: `docker restart dispatcharr`
- Wait 30-60 seconds for full startup
- Refresh the browser page
- Check container logs for errors

### Debugging
**Enable Verbose Logging:**
```bash
docker logs dispatcharr | grep -i epg_janitor
```

**Check Plugin Status:**
```bash
docker exec dispatcharr ls -la /data/plugins/epg_janitor/
```

**Verify Plugin Files:**
```bash
docker exec dispatcharr cat /data/plugins/epg_janitor/__init__.py
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

### Current Version (v0.1)
- **Read-Only Operation**: Plugin cannot modify EPG assignments or channel data
- **Manual Intervention Required**: All fixes must be done through Dispatcharr's web interface
- **No Bulk Operations**: Each channel must be fixed individually
- **No Automated Scheduling**: Scans must be triggered manually
- **No Real-Time Monitoring**: Plugin does not continuously monitor EPG status

### System Limitations
- **Plugin System Constraints**: Limited by the current Dispatcharr plugin API capabilities
- **Memory Usage**: Large channel lineups may require more processing time
- **EPG Source Dependencies**: Results depend on EPG source data quality and availability

### Future Enhancements (Pending Plugin System Development)
- Automated EPG assignment and correction
- Bulk operations for multiple channels
- Scheduled scanning with notifications  
- Direct EPG source validation
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
